Lip Sync Code README
Welcome to the Lip Sync Code repository! This repository contains code and instructions for lip-syncing audio to video using a pre-trained model. In order to get started, please follow the steps below.

Getting Started
1. Mount Google Drive
Before you begin, make sure you have Google Drive set up and mounted on your local machine. This is necessary as we will be working with files stored in Google Drive.

2. Clone the Repository
Clone this GitHub repository to your google drive. 


3. Install Required Libraries
Navigate to the root of the cloned repository and install the required libraries by running the requirement.txt


4. Download Pre-trained Model
To implement the lip syncing algorithm, you need to download the pre-trained model weights (a .pth file) from the provided GitHub repository link. Place the downloaded .pth file in the appropriate directory within your local repository. Make sure to replace the path with the actual location where you store the pre-trained model.

5. Prepare Video and Audio Files
You will need a video and audio file for lip syncing. Please upload these video and audio files to your Google Drive. Note the paths where you store these files, as you will need to specify them in the code. Make sure to replace the paths in the code with the actual paths where your video and audio files are located in your Google Drive.

Modifications in Inference.py
In this version of the lip syncing code, several important modifications have been made to the inference.py file to enhance its functionality and flexibility. These modifications address certain limitations of the pre-trained model, specifically when dealing with videos that do not have a face in every frame. Here are the key changes made:

Handling Frames Without a Face
The original pre-trained model may have had limitations when processing video frames that do not contain a visible face. To address this limitation, changes have been made to the inference.py file to bypass the requirement of a face in every frame for lip syncing. This modification allows for more robust lip syncing, even when the face is not present in all frames of the video.

Please note that these changes aim to improve the lip syncing process, but there may still be areas where further refinements are needed. Achieving better results in scenarios where a face isn't present in every frame will require a deeper understanding of the pre-trained model and may be an ongoing area for improvement.

Feel free to review the updated inference.py file for more details on the specific changes made to address this issue.
